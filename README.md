Description: This project, Bird Species Identification using Audio Signals Classifies birds based on their
audio signals, an artificial neural network model is trained using the dataset. This model classifies the 
bird species for a given input audio file.

since the audio files for this project is very large i couldn't upload it, i downloaded my audio files from kaggle website
you can use the audio files from the site. 

the pre-processing, training, model  python file is included within.
steps: run the code with the input file's path so that all the input files will be pre processed and use the same paths for model training also, rest all actions will be performed 
by the code itself for this to happen you need to first open anaconda prompt and change the current working directory to the directory that contains all the python files and input 
data files, user input files etc, (note: download the user input files for the same input files that you downloaded).
